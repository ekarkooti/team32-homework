Kabab Koobideh Recipe
Yields: 6-8 kababs
Prep time: 30 minutes (plus marinating time)
Cook time: 15-20 minutes

Ingredients:

For the Kabab:

1 kg ground lamb or a mix of lamb and beef (80/20 blend recommended)
2 medium onions, finely grated (use a box grater)
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro
1 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
For Serving (optional):

Cooked rice (Basmati preferred)
Grilled tomatoes and bell peppers
Pita bread or lavash bread
Fresh herbs (mint, basil, parsley)
Lemon wedges
Equipment:

Skewers (flat metal skewers are best)
Food processor or large mixing bowl
Grater (box grater recommended)
Grill or oven broiler
Instructions:

1. Prepare the Meat Mixture:

Grate the onions finely using a box grater, then squeeze out as much of the juice as possible using a cheesecloth or your hands. This step is crucial to prevent the kababs from falling off the skewers.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground meat, grated onion (without the juice), chopped parsley, cilantro, turmeric, cumin, coriander, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and pepper.
Mix the ingredients thoroughly using your hands or a food processor until the mixture is well combined and slightly sticky. This helps the meat adhere to the skewers.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld.
2. Shape the Kababs:

Wet your hands slightly to prevent the meat from sticking.
Take a portion of the meat mixture and shape it into a sausage-like shape around a skewer. Start from the top and gently press the meat onto the skewer, spreading it evenly and firmly.
Flatten the kabab slightly with your fingers, creating ridges along the length. This helps the kabab cook evenly and hold its shape.
Repeat with the remaining meat mixture and skewers.
3. Cook the Kababs:

Grill: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Place the kababs on the grill and cook for about 5-7 minutes per side, or until they are cooked through and have nice grill marks. Turn them carefully to avoid breaking.
Oven Broiler: Preheat your oven broiler. Place the kababs on a baking sheet lined with foil and broil for about 5-7 minutes per side, or until cooked through. Watch closely to prevent burning.
4. Serve:

Serve the Kabab Koobideh immediately with your choice of sides:
Fluffy Basmati rice is a classic accompaniment.
Grilled tomatoes and bell peppers add a touch of sweetness and color.
Wrap the kababs in warm pita or lavash bread for a delicious sandwich.
Garnish with fresh herbs and lemon wedges for extra flavor and freshness.
Tips and Variations:

For a richer flavor, use a mix of lamb and beef with a higher fat content.
You can add other spices to the meat mixture, such as paprika or sumac.
If you don't have access to a grill or broiler, you can cook the kababs in a skillet over medium-high heat.
To prevent the kababs from falling off the skewers, make sure the meat mixture is well combined and sticky, and press it firmly onto the skewers.
Serve with a side of Mast-o Khiar (Persian yogurt and cucumber dip) for a refreshing contrast.
Enjoy your homemade Kabab Koobideh!  Bon app√©tit!
