Ghormeh Sabzi is a beloved Persian stew, known for its vibrant green color and unique tangy flavor. It's a dish that might seem intimidating at first, but with a little patience and the right ingredients, you can create a delicious and authentic Ghormeh Sabzi at home.

Here's a recipe that breaks it down:

Yields: 6-8 servings
Prep time: 45 minutes (plus soaking time for beans)
Cook time: 2-2.5 hours

Ingredients:

For the Stew:

1.5 lbs boneless lamb or beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 large onion, finely chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon turmeric powder   
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
4 cups water or beef broth
4 dried Persian limes (Limoo Amani), pierced with a fork
1 (15-ounce) can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
2 tablespoons lemon juice or lime juice (adjust to taste)
Salt to taste
Olive oil or vegetable oil   
For the Herbs:

1 large bunch (about 4 cups) fresh parsley, finely chopped
1 large bunch (about 3 cups) fresh cilantro, finely chopped
2 bunches green onions (green parts only), finely chopped
1 cup fresh spinach, finely chopped
2 tablespoons dried fenugreek leaves (or 1/4 cup fresh fenugreek, finely chopped)
Equipment:

Large pot or Dutch oven   
Large skillet or frying pan   
Cutting board and knife   
Food processor (optional, for chopping herbs)   
Instructions:

1. Prepare the Beans:

If using dried kidney beans, soak them overnight. Then, cook them separately until tender, and drain. You can also use canned kidney beans for convenience.
2. Brown the Meat:

In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat.
Add the chopped onions and sauté for 5-7 minutes until softened and golden.
Add the minced garlic, turmeric powder, and black pepper. Cook for another minute until fragrant.
Add the beef or lamb cubes and sear on all sides until browned.
3. Simmer the Stew:

Add 4 cups of water or beef broth to the pot. It should just cover the meat. If needed add a little more.
Add the pierced dried limes and bring the stew to a simmer.
Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 1 hour, or until the meat is tender.
4. Prepare the Herbs:

While the meat is simmering, prepare the herbs. Wash and finely chop all the fresh herbs (parsley, cilantro, green onions, spinach). You can use a food processor to chop the herbs, but be careful not to over-process them.   
In a large skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Add the chopped herbs (except fenugreek) and sauté for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they wilt and darken in color.
Add the dried fenugreek leaves (or fresh if using) during the last 2 minutes of cooking the herbs.
5. Combine and Finish the Stew:

After the meat has simmered for an hour, add the sautéed herbs, drained kidney beans, and lemon juice to the pot.
Stir well to combine all the ingredients.
If the stew seems too thick, add a little more water or broth.
Cover the pot and simmer for another 45 minutes to 1 hour, allowing the flavors to meld together.
Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and more lemon juice if needed.
6. Serve:

Ghormeh Sabzi is traditionally served with fluffy basmati rice.   
You can also serve it with a dollop of yogurt or a side of Shirazi salad (a refreshing cucumber, tomato, and onion salad).   
Tips and Variations:

Herb proportions: Feel free to adjust the proportions of the herbs to your liking. Some people prefer more parsley, while others prefer more cilantro.
Dried limes: Dried limes are a key ingredient in Ghormeh Sabzi, giving it its distinct tangy flavor. You can find them at Middle Eastern grocery stores. If you can't find dried limes, you can use lime juice or lemon juice instead, but the flavor won't be quite the same.   
Meat: Lamb is the traditional meat used in Ghormeh Sabzi, but you can also use beef or even chicken.
